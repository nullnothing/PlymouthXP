To avoid redistributing copyrighted Microsoft assets with this project,
you'll need to prepare the required assets for this Plymouth theme yourself.

This directory contains an automated utility to do so, "prepare_assets.py", which requires the following:
 - Python >= 3
 - mtpaint (http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/)
 - wrestool (https://www.nongnu.org/icoutils/)
 - Pillow library for Python (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
 - a copy of "ntoskrnl.exe" from a Windows XP installation
 - a copy of "lucon.ttf" from a Windows XP installation

Install the prerequisites (mtpaint, icoutils, Pillow), place the required
XP files in this directory (ntoskrnl.exe, lucon.ttf), and run prepare_assets.py.

The script works by using mtpaint to apply a colour palette to bitmap files extracted from
ntoskrnl.exe (by wrestool). Then, those image files are automatically modified to add
a region of alpha on the "base" image, and a black border around the "progress" image.
(The scripts comments explain the need for the alpha region & border)

It then assembles the "native mode" background image from the assets,
used for displaying boot messages, or entering passwords for encrypted volumes.

Finally, the lucon.ttf file is used to create sprites from the glyphs in the font.
This is to ensure that the "native mode" text is not anti-aliased before being scaled
to your screen size.
