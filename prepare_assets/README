To avoid redistributing copyrighted Microsoft assets with this project,
you'll need to prepare the required assets for this Plymouth theme yourself.

This directory contains an automated utility to do so, "prepare_assets.py", which requires the following:
 - Python >= 3
 - mtpaint (http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/)
 - wrestool (https://www.nongnu.org/icoutils/)
 - Pillow library for Python (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
 - a copy of "ntoskrnl.exe" from a Windows XP installation

Install mtpaint and icoutils (which provides wrestool), install Python 3 and the Pillow
library, and finally place a copy of ntoskrnl.exe from XP in the working directory.
Then, simply run prepare_assets.py with a Python 3 interpreter.

The script works by using mtpaint to apply a colour palette to bitmap files extracted from
ntoskrnl.exe (by wrestool). Then, those image files are automatically modified to add
a region of alpha on the "base" image, and a black border around the "progress" image.

The script includes more information about why these changes are made to the images.
